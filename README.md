Recommendation System for movies prediction based on users “rating” and “preference”

A recommender system or a recommendation system is a subclass of information filtering system that seeks to predict the “rating” or “preference” a user would give to an item. They are primarily used in commercial applications

There exist two main types of Recommender Systems:

Collaborative Filtering— based on the assumption that people who agreed in the past will agree in the future, and that they will like similar kinds of items as they liked in the past

Content-Based — based on a description of the item and a profile of the user’s preferences. They treat recommendation as a user-specific classification problem and learn a classifier for the user’s likes and dislikes based on product features.
